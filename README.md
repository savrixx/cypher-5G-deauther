## Main Changes
In this new version, I have updated and refined the code. I've tweaked the UI by adding a signal strength indicator and battery level display, and the main feature is that I've also integrated the functionality to sniff deauthed networks, capturing both management and EAPOL frames. The captured frames are automatically compiled into a .pcap file that can be downloaded via browser and processed with hcxpcapngtool to generate a .hc22000 hash file compatible with hashcat.

Please note, this is not a final releaseâ€”there are many improvements planned, and I may eventually focus on a dual BW16 version instead of this one.

## How to Upload Firmware / Usage

1) Go to RTL8720DN_SSD1306_FIX folder. You need to first backup any files that will be replaced, and then add this into your Arduino/libraries folder.
    - This fixes bugs that make Adafruit SSD1306 library incompatible with BW16 board.
2) Upload the firmware using the .ino file via Arduino IDE.
3) Turn it on and select/attack!
4) Credentials to connect to the network to download the .pcap file

## Requirements

- SSD1306
- 3 Buttons
- BW16 Board (DO NOT USE BW16E, 5GHZ DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY WITH IT)
